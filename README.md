RISC-V is an open source ISA. 
In order to develop a better understanding of both VHDL and computer architecture, 
I have decided to design a simple RISC-V CPU with two friends from university. 

This CPU is intended to be implemented as a soft core on the ICE40UP5K FPGA. 
I will also be designing a PCB for this board, which will eventually be found in a subfolder in this repo.
